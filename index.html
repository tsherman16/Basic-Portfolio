            <p id="p1">I was born in Portland, Oregon, but have lived in Arizona for practically my whole life. I graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in Marketing. I met 
            my wife in college and am now married for about two years. During my free time I like to watch sports or stay active. The activities I do to stay active are the gym,
            soccer, basketball, swimming, hiking, and walking my dog. My dog's name is Jax and he is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. Unlike my wife and I he is not active and prefers
            to lay around and get a lot of belly rubs and play tug of war.

            <p id="p2">
            I love watching movies, especially at the theater. My favorite types of movies are comedy, action, thriller, and drama. I hate horror movies and will refuse to go to them, 
            this also includes going to haunted houses. I don't play as many video games as I used to, but when I do I play sports games like Madden, NBA2K, and FIFA. I'm a basic millenial
            and love brunch, especially at OHSO. My favorite foods are chicken and waffles or pretty much any mexican food.
